Filter Permissions
========
Filter Permissions enables you to filter the permission list by role and module 
to make it easier to find the permission you are looking for.

Sites that have one or more of the following factors may struggle to save the
permissions form:
- a large number of modules that have permissions attached
- a large number of content types
- a large number of roles

While there are some functions within Backdrop that try to mitigate this, on
some hosting it may not be possible to adjust (see the [documentation page](https://docs.backdropcms.org/max-input-vars))
and this module can enable saving of permissions, where it would not otherwise
be possible to save.

Filter Permissions does this by only saving the visible permissions.
